This project aims to provide a easy to use API to test any endpoint security headers, we took inspiration from the amazing project from Scott Helme at [Security Headers](http://securityheaders.com) in a form of an api.

We aim to add more functionalities as for example tls test and more based in the OWASP ASVS

We will also be providing a UI for the backend in a separate repo
